####FBX rendered in SVG format using Python  
#This program reads a directory of FBX files and renders each of them in a simple webpage in an SVG format.

Initially, this project started individually by David Barbera but was joined later on by Mircea Catana who offered insights in different ways of using Python bindings to read .fbx files to extract the minimum information to render the model efficiently.
